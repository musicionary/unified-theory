This question plagues me every day. 

What is my identity?  
Are identity and consciousness the same thing? 

If my all my cells have regenerated every seven years, am I the same person that I was in my twenties? How does my consciousness
preserve my sense of identity?

Those are fun questions but not very useful for you, so here's some facts about me:

- I'm a credentialed violist
    - This means that a lot of money changed hands for me to understand music from dead people.
    - Nowadays, this looks like music from people that died a really long time ago. Not Beethoven; older. Older than that.
    - Like [12th century mystics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen) who also happen to be famous composers.

- I'm also a software engineer
    - I generally focus on data-centric software.  In the past this has looked like building data visualization applications, and distributed financial data systems.
    - Currently at [Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com)

- Outside of work, I think and read about human information access, discovery, processing, and retention.
    - We live an a world where, in theory, more information is available to us than we know what to do with.  Knowing how to
    find, filter, and integrate that information into our lives is a significant aspect of the zeitgeist of this century.
    - I believe this area will significantly direct the course of the global population for decades to come.
