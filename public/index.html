  In early winter of this year, just a little before we were it the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in my daily perusing of Hacker News. I came across a post on Superorganizers about personal information storage and retrieval. Little did I know, I was about to head down a months-long endeavor of crafting a system of tools for reading, note-taking, and linking ideas together.
Whether I did this because of quarantine, or whether it would have happened regardless is hard to say, but it been a great way to pass the time.

  This question plagues me every day.
What is my identity?
Are identity and consciousness the same thing?
If my all my cells have regenerated every seven years, am I the same person that I was in my twenties? How does my consciousness preserve my sense of identity?
Those are fun questions but not very useful for you, so here&rsquo;s some facts about me:
  I&rsquo;m a credentialed violist
 This means that a lot of money changed hands for me to understand music from dead people.

  Sometime in late 2019 while perusing Hacker News, I came across a post Consume less, create more. Go read it.
Actually, wait. We all know context switching feels good, but can we just&hellip; not.
Still here? Great, you should still check out that article later.
Essentially, the witty author recounts how their life is vastly weighted towards consuming media instead of creating it. I chuckled in the beginning of the article, but then I read something that felt like a hot iron in my head:

  Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.

  Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.

  Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &lt;root&gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &lt;root&gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.
