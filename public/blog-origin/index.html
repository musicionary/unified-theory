  <h1>The Origin of Unified Theory</h1>
  <time datetime=2020-01-12T15:21:42-0600 class="post-date">Sun, Jan 12, 2020</time>
  <p>Sometime in late 2019 while perusing Hacker News, I came across a post <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/">Consume less, create more</a>.  Go read it.</p>
<p>Actually, wait.  We all know context switching feels good, but can we just&hellip; <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Still here? Great, you should still check out that article later.</p>
<p>Essentially, the witty author recounts how their life is vastly weighted towards consuming media instead of creating it.  I chuckled in the beginning of the article, but then I read something that felt like a hot iron in my head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram—we can all agree that these are serious timewasters. But what about The Economist or War and Peace? How much can you really remember from all of those New York Times op-eds you’ve read? Could you summarize the major themes of Grapes of Wrath?
Most knowledge worth having comes from practice. It comes from doing. It comes from creating. Reading about the trade war with China doesn’t make you smarter—it gives you something to say at dinner parties. It gives you the illusion that you have the vaguest idea what is happening in our enormously complex world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I don't find myself at many dinner parties but there's something about that idea, of reading just to have something smart to say that is incredibly incisive.  In 2019, according to Goodreads, I read 37 books.  Some might feel good about that.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>If you asked me to describe the major themes or thesis from most of those books, I don't think I could do it. I could probably give you a one-liner on each of them, at best. So yeah, long-term retention on that stuff wasn't exactly I'd brag about.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I pick up books because their topics seem interesting to me.  I trend towards voraciously gourging myself on information.  But to be honest, I probably finish them quicker than would be most beneficial.  I read like I chew. You know how much you're <em>supposed</em> to chew? 32 times. <strong>32 times</strong>.  Who has time for that? I chew twice, that's it.</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a shocking concept that spending more time with the information consume is beneficial to ourselves and others.  In a world that is flooded with content, it isn't always the person that remembers the most that has the most to offer. It's probably the person that can connect disparate concepts in intruiging, and story-driven ways.</p>
<p>That's why Malcolm Gladwell can talk about tomato soup and it makes you re-examine your whole life.</p>
<p>Ingesting media and deriving inspiring ideas in that way takes time, takes marinating.  And this is what this blog sets out to do. No not <em>that</em>.  Make your own tomato soup.</p>
<p>My aim, as I read through my book list for the year, is to create some way of connecting whatever I'm reading, regardless of how unrelated the books are. In some cases, I think it'll be easier.  In other cases, it's gonna be trying to figure out how 21st century post-neo-liberal economics relates to a catholic priest that goes to another planet with sentient life and what that means for faith.</p>
