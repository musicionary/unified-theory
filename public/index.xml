      <description>In early winter of this year, just a little before we were it the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in my daily perusing of Hacker News. I came across a post on Superorganizers about personal information storage and retrieval. Little did I know, I was about to head down a months-long endeavor of crafting a system of tools for reading, note-taking, and linking ideas together.
Whether I did this because of quarantine, or whether it would have happened regardless is hard to say, but it been a great way to pass the time.</description>

      <description>This question plagues me every day.
What is my identity?
Are identity and consciousness the same thing?
If my all my cells have regenerated every seven years, am I the same person that I was in my twenties? How does my consciousness preserve my sense of identity?
Those are fun questions but not very useful for you, so here&amp;rsquo;s some facts about me:
  I&amp;rsquo;m a credentialed violist
 This means that a lot of money changed hands for me to understand music from dead people.</description>

      <description>Sometime in late 2019 while perusing Hacker News, I came across a post Consume less, create more. Go read it.
Actually, wait. We all know context switching feels good, but can we just&amp;hellip; not.
Still here? Great, you should still check out that article later.
Essentially, the witty author recounts how their life is vastly weighted towards consuming media instead of creating it. I chuckled in the beginning of the article, but then I read something that felt like a hot iron in my head:</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
